Your task:


- find a static analysis tool for a language of interest

- find a file in an open source project of interest

Post to the #assignment1claims channel in slack a tuple of the form:


(

- NAU login - e.g. adg326 for me,
- GitHub repo or other location of open source project,
- Filename with full directory location info,
- Programming language,
- Tool to be used

)

Only one person can analyze a particular file with a particular tool, so if you want a popular choice, you need to stake it early!


For the assignment, send to our secret class email drop an email with subject 499 ASSIGNMENT 1 and attach a zip file with name yourNAUlogin.assign1.zip (e.g. adg326.assign1.zip for me) with:

- text file README.txt with the same info as the tuple above
- the source file you analyzed
- tool output text or screenshot if not a text output kinda tool
- a one to two page pdf writeup of your understanding of the results, what's interesting, any real bugs found, etc.

Bonus points for:

- using multiple tools and comparing results
- connecting results to technical ideas from static analysis (e.g., "The tool did not identify this problem because of pointer indirection on line XYZ, I believe.")
